# A Stock Market Monitoring Application
Imagine you are tasked with developing a stock market monitoring application that provides real-time stock price updates to users. In this application, users can subscribe to specific stocks they are interested in, and they want to be notified whenever the price of a subscribed stock changes. Here's how the Observer Design Pattern can be applied:

## Subject (Observable): Stock Market Data Feed
The stock market data feed serves as the subject or observable in this scenario. It continuously receives stock price updates from various sources.

## Observers: User Subscribers
Each user who subscribes to specific stocks is an observer. They want to be notified whenever the price of a stock they are interested in changes.

## Observers' Implementations: Notification Mechanisms
For each user, you have different notification mechanisms they can choose from, such as email, SMS, or push notifications. These mechanisms are the observers' implementations.

Here's how the Observer Design Pattern is helpful in this software development scenario:

* Whenever the stock market data feed receives an update for a particular stock (e.g., Apple Inc.), it notifies all the subscribed users interested in that stock.
* Each user can choose their preferred notification method (e.g., email or push notification). These notification mechanisms are the observers' implementations.
* When the data feed notifies a user about a stock price change, it doesn't need to know how that user wants to be notified. It simply sends the notification request, and the user's chosen notification mechanism (observer's implementation) handles the delivery of the message.
* If you add more stocks or users to the system, you don't need to modify the data feed or the notification mechanisms. The Observer Pattern allows for flexible and dynamic subscription management.

In this software development scenario:

* The stock market data feed is the "subject" or the "observable."
* The users who subscribe to stocks are the "observers."
* The email, SMS, and push notification mechanisms are the "observers' implementations."

The Observer Design Pattern makes it easy to maintain and extend the application. It decouples the subject (stock market data feed) from the observers (users and their notification mechanisms), allowing for a scalable and flexible solution. This decoupling ensures that changes to one part of the system don't require changes in other parts, promoting robust and maintainable code.
